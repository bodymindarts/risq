# Continuous Intergation

the ci folder contains everything needed to setup an automated test / build / release pipeline using [concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/).
- Use the fly cli to authenticate to your running concourse.
- Edit the [settings.yml](./settings.yml) file if you'd like to change a configuration
- run the `ci/repipe` (requires [spruce](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce/releases) to be installed)
